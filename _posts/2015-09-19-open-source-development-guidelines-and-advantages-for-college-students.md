title: Open source development guidelines and advantages for college students
---

As an engieering graduate and software developer, i always wondered what is the correct way to learn coding (like there was a manual for it :P). I found this was a question many of my peers are searching answer for themselves too. I found this very strange as why there wasnt a clear guideline for it and always felt curriculum lacked practical knowledge. Per say we search for a cheatcode we can use (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKZ_pWYSMk">'comeflywithme'</a> from game i need not name) and be geeks of all time.  
This blog is an advice for past me and hopefully any student out there trying to figure out coding.  
> Lets get the obvious out of way,  
> - use google like you mean it  
> - practise practise practise (repeated as its that important)  
> - problem solving approach is more important than anything  
> - never even think you can not do it  
> - review it, ask your friends to review and get better
