title: Open source development guidelines and advantages for college students
---

As an engieering graduate and software developer, i always wondered what is the correct way to learn coding (like there was a manual for it :P). I found this was a question many of my peers are searching answer for themselves too. I found this very strange as why there wasnt a clear guideline for it and always felt curriculum lacked practical knowledge. Per say we search for cheatcode we can use (like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKZ_pWYSMk">'comeflywithme'</a> from game i need not name) and be geeks of all time.  

This blog is an advice for past me and hopefully any student out there trying to figure out coding.
